"""The exposure guard rides the APP OBJECT, and is derived from the S2S SCHEME, not a credential.

The defect this file is the standing guard for: the only bound on serving the zero-secret `local`
posture to the network lived in `resolve_bind_host(...)`, inside `main()`. The shipped entry point
never reaches `main()`: the Dockerfile CMD is

    exec uvicorn agent_registry.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8083}

so the bound was a property of one entry point rather than of the application. Executed against
this repo with `AGENT_REGISTRY_PROFILE=local`, a peer at 203.0.113.7 carrying no credential read
`/v1/agents`, `/v1/governance/agents` and the whole `/v1/capabilities` manifest.

A3 is a CONTROL PLANE with no end user: its callers are SERVICES. So the question the guard has
to settle is "can this deployment authenticate the callers it answers?", and the answer comes from
the S2S SCHEME the profile binds, never from a credential:

* under `gcp` the bearer is a Google-signed OIDC ID token, verified against its issuer, expiry and
  audience and then matched against a caller allowlist. Callers cannot name themselves, so they
  ARE authenticated, and the guard stands down: that deployment is fronted by the platform and
  every catalog route refuses an unverified caller on its own;
* under `local`, `onprem` and an unconfigured run the scheme compares a symmetric shared string,
  which is anonymous, and under a deliberate `local` with the string unset the routes are OPEN.
  None of that is authentication, so the guard applies.

Whether `AGENT_REGISTRY_S2S_TOKEN` is SET must never enter the decision. It says nothing about
`/healthz` and `/v1/capabilities`, which carry no credential by design, and a guard derived from a
credential switches OFF exactly when an operator configures one. The scanner at the bottom fails
the build if the guard's argument reaches a credential at any depth.

Both directions are asserted, and so is the case that matters most for a control plane: a sibling
service calling over LOOPBACK with a real token still works.
