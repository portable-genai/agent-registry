"""EVERY profile builds in an interpreter where the cloud SDKs cannot be imported.

Not "no SDK installed on this machine": ``tests/_sdk_free_probe.py`` installs a meta-path
finder that refuses the ``google`` and ``vertexai`` roots, then constructs every adapter
binding of the profile in a fresh process. Proving the claim by absence would tie it to the
developer machine: one with the SDK installed would pass while hiding an eager import that
breaks the offline gate everywhere else.

Every profile, INCLUDING ``gcp``, and that is the point rather than an overreach. The AlloyDB
and Firestore adapters import their SDK lazily, inside the method that needs it, so they
CONSTRUCT with no SDK present; that laziness is what lets a fork run the offline stack without
installing a cloud SDK at all, and AGENTS.md lists it as a non-negotiable.

Nothing enforced it. The contract suite resolves the managed binding through a dotted string,
so nothing in this repository imported ``adapters/gcp`` under prohibition, and a ``from
google.cloud import alloydb_connector`` hoisted to module scope there would leave the gate
green with the constraint broken and the breakage invisible until an offline machine tried to
serve. Constructing the managed profile under the same prohibition is what closes that hole,
and it was proved by planting exactly that hoisted import and watching only the ``gcp`` case
go red.

``tests/test_contract.py`` proves the bindings satisfy their Protocols in-process; this
file proves every one of them imports and constructs under prohibition.
