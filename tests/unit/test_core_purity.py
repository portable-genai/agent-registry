"""The core imports only the standard library, its own package and the workspace kits.

The core is the code a client owns outright after an extraction: the decision records, the
serialization of them and the port contracts. A cloud or model SDK import there is lock-in
wearing a green gate. The rule is an allowlist rather than an SDK blocklist, because a
blocklist rots the day a vendor renames a distribution.

THIS REPOSITORY HAS NO ``domain/`` PACKAGE. agent-registry is a small control plane, so its core
sits flat beside the wiring, and AGENTS.md already names it: ``models.py`` (the AgentCard and its
lifecycle types), ``cards.py`` (their dict form), ``self_card.py`` (the registry's own card),
``release_policy.py`` (the promotion rules) and the ``ports/`` package (the Protocol).
:data:`CORE_LAYERS` therefore names modules as well as directories, and the scan below accepts
either. Everything else under ``src/agent_registry`` is deliberately outside that boundary and free
to depend on its framework: ``config.py`` and ``schemas.py`` are the YAML / pydantic edge,
``container.py`` is the wiring, and ``api/``, ``cli/`` and ``adapters/`` are adapters by definition.
``release_verifier.py`` is outside it too, and deliberately: it declares a port Protocol but also
carries the concrete verifier that fetches evidence over HTTP, so it imports ``httpx``. A port whose
module also holds an adapter is not core, whatever the file is called.

Twin of the core-purity section of the fleet-wide portfolio gate,
which repeats this scan across every repository in the workspace. This copy travels with the
repository when it is extracted and handed over, which is exactly when the workspace scan can
no longer see it.

The dynamic blocked-import probe (``tests/_sdk_free_probe.py``) proves the SDK-free profiles
construct with the SDK unimportable; this static scan additionally catches a lazy import
inside a function body on a call path that profile construction never exercises.
